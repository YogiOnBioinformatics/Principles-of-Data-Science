```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

```

1. Sum of Squared Errors: 

```{r}


mod = lm(mpg~. , data = mtcars)
residuals = augment(mod, mtcars) %>% select(.resid) 
residuals^2 %>% sum()

```


2. Coefficients that are significantly different from zero: 

```{r}

summary(mod)

```

According to the p-values, none of the coefficients are significantly differ from zero. 


3. Row numbers for the first partition for the training data are rows 1-4,6-8, 10-16, 18-19, 21-26, 30-32.

4. Based on the SSE value from cross-validation, we get 593. However, in excercise 1 we got an SSE of 147.4944.
